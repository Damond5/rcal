# rcal

A terminal-based calendar application built with Rust and Ratatui.

## Description

rcal is a simple yet powerful calendar application that runs entirely in your terminal. It provides an intuitive text-based user interface for managing events, with support for notifications and persistent storage.

Key benefits:
- **TUI Interface**: Navigate and manage your calendar without leaving the terminal
- **Notifications**: Get desktop notifications for upcoming events via daemon mode
- **Persistence**: Events are stored as markdown files in your home directory

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Interactive calendar view with month/week navigation
- Add, view, edit, and delete events
- Support for multi-day events with start and end dates and times
- All-day events (leave time field empty when creating)
- Event details including title, start/end dates, start/end times, and description
- Flexible time input formats (HH:MM, HH, H)
- End date input format: DD/MM with automatic year assumption

### Advanced Features
- Daemon mode for background notifications (30 minutes before timed events, midday the day before for all-day events)
- Real-time file watching for event updates
- Unicode support in text input
- Confirmation dialogs for safe operations
- Asynchronous Git-based synchronization for cross-device event sharing (auto-sync happens in background)

### Supported Formats
- Markdown-based event storage
- Desktop notifications via D-Bus
- Terminal-based UI with keyboard navigation
- Git synchronization for remote repositories

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo package manager
- For notifications: A D-Bus compatible desktop environment

```

### Build from Source

- `rcal --sync-push`: Push events to remote
- `rcal --sync-status`: Check sync status
- `rcal --help`: Show help information

### Keybindings

- **Confirm Delete**: `y` or `Y` (in confirmation dialog)

### Examples
```bash
# View calendar
rcal

# Run notifications daemon
rcal --daemon

# Initialize sync with GitHub repo
rcal --sync-init https://github.com/user/my-calendar.git

# Pull latest events
rcal --sync-pull

# Push local changes
rcal --sync-push

# Check sync status
rcal --sync-status

# Add an event (interactive)
rcal
# Then press Enter on a date and fill in details

# Access sync menu in TUI
rcal
# Press s to open sync popup, then f/p/s to pull/push/status
```

## Configuration

### Event Storage
Events are stored as individual markdown files in `~/calendar/` directory, one per event with title-based filenames. See EVENT_FORMAT.md for the detailed event format specification.
- Events include title, start date, start time, end date, end time, and description

### Notification Settings
- Daemon checks for events 30 minutes ahead
- Notifications use system desktop notification service
- Duplicate notifications are prevented per session

### Sync Configuration
- Remote URL stored in `~/.config/rcal/config.toml`
- Uses SSH keys for Git authentication
- Supports rebase-based pulling to avoid merge commits
- Automatic pull on launch and push on save/delete happen asynchronously in background threads
- Conflicts must be resolved manually in the markdown files

### Customization
Currently, rcal uses default settings. Future versions may support configuration files for themes and notification preferences.

## Development
