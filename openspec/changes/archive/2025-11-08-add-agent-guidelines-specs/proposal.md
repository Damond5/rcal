# Add Agent Guidelines as OpenSpec Specs

This change proposal migrates all agent guidelines from AGENTS.md into formal OpenSpec specifications. The guidelines cover development commands, code style, testing strategies, design choices, and test coverage requirements.

## Motivation

Currently, agent guidelines are documented in a single AGENTS.md file. To improve maintainability and ensure consistency, these guidelines should be formalized as OpenSpec specs that can be validated and tracked.

## Impact

- Formalizes development processes as verifiable requirements
- Enables automated validation of code style and testing practices
- Provides clear specifications for all design choices
- Improves onboarding for new contributors

## Scope

Adds specifications for:
- Build and development tools
- Code style and conventions
- Testing framework and strategy
- TUI architecture patterns
- UI rendering guidelines
- Error handling approaches
- Event management features
- Synchronization implementation
- Packaging and distribution
- Test coverage metrics
